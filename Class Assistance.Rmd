## C21 (pg498) 

#### Determine if the linear transformation $S:\quad { P }_{ 3 }\rightarrow { M }_{ 22 }$ is (a) injective, (b) surjective,(c) invertible.

$$S(a+bx+c{ x }^{ 2 }+d{ x }^{ 3 })=\left[ \begin{matrix} -a & +4b & +c & +2d \\ a & +5b & -2c & +2d \end{matrix}\quad \quad \begin{matrix} 4a & -b & +6c & -d \\ a &  & +2c & +5d \end{matrix} \right]$$

```{r}
# Creating matrix into S
(S <- matrix(c(-1,4,1,1,4,-1,5,0,1,6,-2,2,2,-1,2,5), 4,4))
```

```{r}
# RREF
(answer <- rref(S))
```

#### Answer:

The identity matrix is nonsingular and have null space therefore it is injective. Uâ€™s dimension is 4 and kernel is 0 therefore it is also surjective. Lastly, transformation is injective and surjective therefore it is also invertible as well as per ILTIS theorem.
